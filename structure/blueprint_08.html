<!-- # HTML Structure
Now that we know how to spin up a web page, let's get back to the basics and explore how to structure our HTML files better. ðŸ“„

Here are some must-haves in a .html file!

The <!DOCTYPE html> is the document type declaration that appears at the top of a .html file and tells the browser that our file is written in HTML5. This is used with a <html> element containing all the code processed on the page.

Notice how the <!DOCTYPE html> doesnâ€™t have a closing tag, while <html> does.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  Code goes here
</html>

Note: All HTML files must start with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and the <html> element.

We skipped them in the first chapter, but they are essential parts of every HTML file.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    Some code goes here
  </head>
  <body>
    A lot more goes here
  </body>
</html>

Inside <html>, there should be two elements:

<head>: This contains all the info for your browser that's not visible on the page.
<body>: This contains all of the content that you will end up seeing on the page.
The <title> element goes in the <head> and assigns text to the tab in our browser.

This is what the browser tab looks like when you visit codedex.io:

Red arrow pointing at title text of browser tab

The code for this would be:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>CodÃ©dex | Start your coding adventure â‹†Ë™âŸ¡</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Code goes here
  </body>
</html>

Instructions
Let's practice HTML structure by creating a file called blueprint.html.

Make sure to add the following:

A <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
A <html> element with:
A <head> element with a page title.
A <body> element with a paragraph.
You now have the blueprint that you can use for all future HTML files! -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>blueprint</title>
  </head> 
  <body>
    <p>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
