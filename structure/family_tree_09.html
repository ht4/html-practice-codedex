<!-- Parents & Children
The elements in our HTML file are arranged much like a family tree. Most individual elements can be parents with one or more child elements.

For example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Well, <i>howdy</i> there!</p>
  </body>
</html>

Here are some relationships:

<head> and <body> are children of <html>.
<title> is the child of <head>.
<i> is child of <p> and grandkid of <body>.
Now, what’s the relationship between <i> and <title>? Haha kidding.

# Siblings
Elements can also be siblings if they share a direct parent element. Take this unordered list, for instance:

<body>
  <ul>
    <li>🍄 Mario</li>
    <li>🐢 Luigi</li>
  </ul>
</body>

The two <li> elements are siblings because both are children of the same parent, the <ul> element.

Instructions
"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."

Create a family_tree.html file for your family using list elements such as <ul> and <li> elements. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

If you are stuck, try doing one for the British Royal Family, the Kardashians, or the Simpsons.

Once you are done, ask yourself:

Which elements are parents?
Which elements are children?
Which elements are siblings?
Note: Remember to set up your web page properly. (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, etc.) -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
     Incas_tree_family
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>
      Incas tree family
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Túpac Inca Yupanqui family
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Túpac Inca Yupanqui 
      <ul>
        <li>Huayna Cápac
        <ul>
          <li>Huáscar </li>
          <li>Atahualpa</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first element, Túpac Inca Yupanqui, is the parent of Huayna Cápac. Huáscar and Atahualpa are siblings and children of Huayna Cápac.
